### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Teslim (or just call me Alpha) from Nigeria and I'm a Mobile Application developer. I'm familiar with the syntax of major languages and also the basics of Web development. However, I major in cross platfrom app development with the Flutter framework. I'm a SELF-TAUGHT developer so the journey has been rough but yeah, Im proud of my progress so far.
